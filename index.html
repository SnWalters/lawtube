                Under <span>NO</span> circumstances are you to take what
                is said by the &quot;Lawtube&quot; creators as legal advice!
                </p>

                <p>
                If you're seeking any kind of legal advice, consult a lawyer
                or lawfirm in your area.
                </p>

                <p>
                Although the content creators in the &quot;Laywers&quot;
                section <span>ARE</span> actual lawyers, they are simply
                providing you with great content to fill your free time. While
                at times, teaching those of us who <span>AREN'T</span> laywers,
                some of the subtleties of why we hire folks such as themselves.

                I created this website of my own volition! I was not hired
                by any the creators mentioned on this site.
                </p>

                <p>
                So, if you don't like anything on this site, let
                <span>ME</span> know.
                </p>

                <p>
                I have a <a href="complaint.html">complaint department</a>
                you can consult. I know it looks a lot like a trash can.
                But I assure you, I <span>WILL</span> take your critisism
                with a grain of salt!
                </p>

                This site was created for entertainment purposes, for the most
                part. If you get offended by any of the quips or jokes on here,
                then perhaps you'd be happier by clicking on that red button
                at the top of your screen.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                You know, the one with the <span class="x">X</span> in it.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div>

                <p>
                And with all of the psuedo-legal crap out of the way...
                </p>

                <p>
                Keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times, and for
                petes sake, make sure to keep your windows up, while wearing
                your mask, while driving in your convertible! (Yes, I've
                literally seen that before, but never mind that!!)
                </p>

                <p>
                Please enjoy your stay.
